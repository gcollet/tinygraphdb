TinygraphDb is a tiny graph database engine written in C++

I will need help to develop it because I will use it in my personal project 
but I don't know what are the needs for other projects.

Feel free to participate !

In version 1.0.1, you can create a graph database with nodes and arcs (vertex and edges) under a given policy. The policy defines the types of nodes (strictly) and the type of arc between two nodes.

Example:

protein->[has id]->db_id

This policy defines an arc of type "has id" from a node of type "protein" to a node of type "db_id". If you try to create an arc of type "has id" from a node of type "db_id" to a node of type "protein", an exception is thrown.

TODOs:

Add some algorithms like graph traversal, map reduce, etcâ€¦
These algorithms can be used but not directly (you have to code it).

Add a graphDb with no policy (no constraints on arc and node types)
